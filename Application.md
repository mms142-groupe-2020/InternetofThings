## Daily-Lives

IoT can already be observed mostly anywhere in the world especially in an urban location where the environment is modern and up-to-date with the current technologies. For example, smart gadgets at home are a product of IoT like our smartphones, smartwatches, other wearable technologies, and smart machines (for example, appliances that can be connected to a smartphone). The gadgets we use store our information and record our usage and use that data to customize our usage or improve their function depending on how we use them.

The moment the users accept the user-agreement on the privacy policy of a product, the product’s company becomes a part of the IoT because they would allow the company to gather data from them. This is also apparent from the online services we use and the applications we have on our smartphones and computers. Most users are not aware of this and do not read the privacy policy of the appliance or service and they might be unaware that their information is being recorded. This is not much of a concern because most of the companies that provide these IoT products adhere to the law and do not collect unnecessary and personal data but some do not follow the rules and inappropriately use the data they gathered (“Privacy Policy for IoT Devices”, 2019).

## Medical Field

IoT technology is applied in the medical field in various ways. It can monitor the health condition of the user via specialized gadgets or through application services; the devices they use may be monitoring their health status and body condition in real-time like their heartbeat, sugar level, blood pressure, and other factors and records it (Tedx Talks, 2014). If the data on their body goes past certain levels the users will be informed through their gadgets, for example, their heartbeat suddenly slowed down below average they would be informed to take emergency medicines and it may inform their condition to an emergency agency like the nearest hospital. Data inputted in the IoT device can only be seen by authorized persons protecting the privacy of the user. IoT technology is also used in developing and improving medical technology. They gather data from patients and medical practitioners to invent a new technology or make improvements to address their needs. The data that IoT has gathered is essential to know what changes they need to make to make their technology useful and cost-efficient. 

## Business

IoT technology is used by big companies and informal businesses. A company prepares its products to adapt to the ever-changing trends in the market. IoT plays an important role in gathering and recording data to make sure the products and services they offer would be bought by their customers. They can also improve their products and services based on the feedback they receive from their customer’s data. In short, IoT helps improve the company’s product and services and improves their customer’s experience.

IoT technology is also used for inventory and better management. Data is automatically processed better tracked, reducing any errors because of its well-designed program. The information or data doesn’t come from just one source but many and they are all being processed and combined and it can be viewed in a summary.

## Agriculture

“Smart farming based on IoT technologies enables growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity ... The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere”- (“IoT Transforming the Future of Agriculture”). IoT technology is also used in agriculture allowing farmers to better monitor their crops and program some farming processes automatically. IoT would help lessen the workload and cost-effectively improve productivity.

According to the article by Ravindra (2020), the application of such technologies allows for more autonomy and precision without sacrificing quality relative to more analog methods. For starters, they brought up the concept of “Smart Farming” that allows for easy monitoring of humidity, crop status, and the quality of the soil. This will guarantee more consistent crop quality and better management and handling of crops and goods as they grow. Another benefit would be the reduction of waste in terms of residuals and resources, an example of which would be the water used to keep the crops hydrated, as well as the feeds used to nourish the livestock. This is done by automating and monitoring the resources being used so that they’ll only use the necessary amounts. 

## Manufacturing

On the topic of Manufacturing, one of the many goals for manufacturers is proper optimization and efficiency to create more products and reduce potential waste without sacrificing time and quality. With the help of IoT, a path has been carved towards this direction. One of many ways IoT technology is applied that was presented in the article “IoT in Manufacturing” (Ilchenko, 2020) was the practice of Predictive Repairing. This application allows automatic monitoring and repair of equipment and products to anticipate potential errors and faults to reduce the risk of major malfunctions, potentially reducing the costs and risks. Another great application of IoT is the utilization of Remote Production Control that allows the manufacturer to manually manage the production anywhere. This would allow for quick and easier management of equipment as it is no longer necessary to be on-site to control them. This also allows the management to keep track of necessary data such as tracking personnel’ locations and equipment status. And finally, we have the concept of “Digital Twins”. Previously, when manufacturing something that requires circuitry and automation, One would have to wait for a physical product as a base to start. This applies to different stages as well such as maintenance and quality assurance. But through Digital Twins, they make use of simulation and digital replicas to immediately start with the next procedures without waiting for physical products. This can cut production time without sacrificing quality.
