The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the platform connecting various objects, enabling object-to-object communication without human involvement. It hosts different technologies such as sensors and application program interface (API) to collect and exchange data.

Recent technological innovations preempting the current of IoT include the easing access to technological wares such as broadband Internet and connections to these networks, alongside the increasing numbers of devices with Wi-Fi capabilities and sensors. The following trends serve as preconditions that can catalyze IoT's further growth in our society:

* As the cost for connectivity decreases, there will be an upsurge in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) connected objects, estimated to be 50 billion by 2020 according to Cisco. The existence of a multitude of untapped bandwidth in locked wireless connections urged the [OpenWireless.org](http://openwireless.org) initiative to support an open wi-fi movement as they work on security issues such as allowing control for owners to direct the user traffic using anonymity software such as TOR or VPN. Combining these possibilities can result in a wider network of digitally connected devices.

* Smart objects will include powerful embedded processors such as Intel's Braswell, a multicore system-on-a-chip (SoC), Broadcom's Bluetooth Smart SoC, and ARM's Cortex-M processors and along with AMD, embedded chips such as the Hierofalcon 64-bit SoC for the IoT. Improvements on flash memory and RAM capacity can push IoT's capabilities in storing data within personal area network (PAN) and machine-to-machine communication. These developments can create IoT's with supercomputer processing.

* Improvements in wireless sensor networks (WSN) through cooperative relaying can result in the network's longer lifespan and a more robust signal—as receivers combine the same signals that the source and a third node transmits. WSNs are a subset of IoT, as it needs to route the data to a router or central node in common base stations before it can connect to the internet, however, star topologies provide a central gateway for WSN to access the Internet in "one-hop."

* Numerous studies and attempts to create a wireless ad hoc network—an autonomous and self-organizing network—can decentralize existing data infrastructures. This is comprised of mobile network nodes that can communicate directly with other nodes, thus creating temporary functional networks. This can disrupt the present data network architecture which relies on different infrastructures

There are numerous applications of WSN that when combined with IoT can build highly specialized systems such as "smart cities" that are greatly compatible with their users' needs and preferences. These spaces collate data considering their safety and energy consumption to build an efficient, waste-reducing, and time & energy-saving system. Human-centric WSNs mainly applied to healthcare institutions collects and analyzes data related to one's health and well-being. Applications can warn users when sensing dangerous levels of blood pressure, oxygen concentration, air quality, among others.

WSNs can monitor environments such as natural habitats to aid studies, exploration, and even protection of these habitats and the species they host. Agricultural industries can also use IoT to aid processes based on meteorological factors. IoTs can control and mitigate destructions based on the data it collated such as the structural health of manmade infrastructures. It can monitor traffic entities to control congestion as well as support surveillance systems to increase security.

IoTs can also monitor and control industrial processes such as machine maintenance and surveillance—even automation. Objects can also be tracked and monitored by adding a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. This can make logistic processes efficient and transparent.
